Using python3.7, pandas, aiohttp and whatever additional open source packages that you would like please code the following:

Create an HTTP server that runs on localhost and serves a single endpoint /forecast. This forecast endpoint will take in a json serialized dataframe of prices that has securities as columns and is datetime indexed.

You must produce a json serialized dataframe that is a linear interpolation of what the next trading day will produce.  So for a given security if you have 9/3 that is $1 and 9/4 that is $2 and 9/5 that is $3 you might predict 9/6 is $4 for this security.

There may be null values, the security may not have traded that day for some reason (perhaps it is all gibbons day in west pennslytucky where this is traded, I don't know - do you?). You must skip these and still provide an interpolated result. If you have one or zero data points for a security you must return Nan/None or some other non-numerical value.

Example:
curl localhost:8080/post -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
